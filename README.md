Module 14
## Overview
The purpose of this assignment was to get data on the NYC bike usage to see what are the key characteristics and to see if this company would do well in a new city. Using the data given we were able to create visualizes of key aspects of the company and get key relationships. Not only did we analysis the data but we created visualizes to make the data tell a story.
## Results
First we created a visualization of all the rides based upon the time. This visualization showed a peak at 5 pm. Next, we created a visualization of the same data but filtered by gender. This showed us that the primary users were male. Next we created 3 heatmaps for the given data. These heatmaps showed us that prime usage was between 5 pm and 6 pm and once again males were the primary users.
## Summary
The results showed us that the user base is primarily males and the primary hours of usage is between 5 pm and 6pm.
